When writing documentation, remember the following:
  - warn the programmer to ALWAYS set newly declared dstring_t's to NULL!
  - All read-only standard library functions can be used by using
    dstrview(dstring_t)

If you're low on memory, can reduce mem used by doing:
   dstrealloc(&str, dstrlen(str)), since allocation can be much greater
than the size of the actual string

dstrdel() will return char that was removed, so can use this like a "pop"
