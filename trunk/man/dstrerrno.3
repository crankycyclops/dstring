.TH "dstrerrno" 3 "12 July 2007" "dstrerrno" "Dstring Library"

.SH NAME
dstrerrno - external variable of type int, designed to signify success or the \
nature of the error after a call to a dstring function.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <dstring.h>"

.SH DESCRIPTION

The dstring.h header file makes the external variable "int dstrerrno" \
available, which is guaranteed to be set by every call to a dstring \
function and will indicate success or the nature of the error.

.B "WARNING:"
dstrerrno is NOT thread safe!  Thus, reliable multithreaded code \
MUST make effective use of locking in order to ensure that only one thread \
is granted access to dstrerrno at any one time.  Later versions of this \
library will employ a thread-safe version of dstrerrno, rendering this extra \
step unnecessary.

The possible error codes that dstrerrno can be set to are as follows:

.B "DSTR_SUCCESS"
Success

.B "DSTR_NOMEM"
Insufficient memory

.B "DSTR_INVALID_BUFLEN"
The caller passed an invalid buffer length (less than 0)

.B "DSTR_UNINITIALIZED"
The caller tried to pass an uninitialized dstring_t object (HINT: it's a \
VERY good idea to immediately set all newly declared dstring_t variables to \
NULL; this is the only way a dstring function can tell whether or not an \
object has been initialized!)

.B "DSTR_UNOPENED_FILE"
A NULL FILE pointer was passed

.B "DSTR_EOF"
End of file has been reached for a file stream (not necessarily an error)

.B "DSTR_FILE_ERROR"
A read error (not EOF) was encountered when trying to read from a file stream

.B "DSTR_OUT_OF_BOUNDS"
The specified index in a dstring_t object is out of bounds

.B "DSTR_INVALID_ARGUMENT"
An invalid argument was passed to a dstring.h function

.B "DSTR_NULL_CPTR"
a NULL character pointer was discovered where a C string was expected

The function
.B "dstrerrormsg(3)"
can be called with the current value of dstrerrno to return a constant C \
string describing the nature of the error.  Thus, to print a more "friendly" \
representation of dstrerrno, one may do something like this:

printf("error: %s\\n", dstrerrormsg(dstrerrno));
