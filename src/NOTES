-When writing documentation, remember the following:
  - warn the programmer to ALWAYS set newly declared dstring_t's to NULL!
  - All read-only standard library functions can be used by using
    dstrview(dstring_t)

If you're low on memory, can reduce mem used by doing:
   dstrealloc(&str, dstrlen(str)), since allocation can be much greater
than the size of the actual string

dstrdel() will return char that was removed, so can use this like a "pop"

In general, setting newly declared pointers to NULL is a good programming
practice.  Libdstring will do its part to reward you by checking arguments
(both dstring_t objects and char *) to make sure they really point to
something.
